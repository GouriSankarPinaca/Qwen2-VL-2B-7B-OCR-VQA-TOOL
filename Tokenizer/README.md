# In Hugging Face
**Tokenizer** is used to preprocess text data into tokens suitable for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as training neural networks or applying pre-trained models. Here's an overview of different types of tokenizers available in Hugging Face:
Types of Tokenizers:

-  **PreTrainedTokenizer:**
        These tokenizers are used for models that are already pre-trained and available in the Hugging Face model hub. They come with predefined tokenization rules and vocabulary tailored to the specific model.
        Example: BertTokenizer, GPT2Tokenizer, XLNetTokenizer.
-  **kenizer:**
        General tokenizers that can be customized for specific tasks or languages. They offer more flexibility compared to PreTrainedTokenizer.
        Example: AutoTokenizer, which automatically selects the appropriate tokenizer based on the model type (BERT, GPT-2, etc.).

-  **Specialized Tokenizers:**
        These tokenizers are designed for specific tasks or languages, offering optimized tokenization rules and performance enhancements.
        Example: BertTokenizerFast, GPT2TokenizerFast, which provide faster tokenization compared to their standard counterparts.

When to Use Each Type of Tokenizer:

-  **PreTrainedTokenizer**: Use these tokenizers when you are working with a specific pre-trained model that is available in the Hugging Face model hub. They ensure compatibility with the model's vocabulary and tokenization rules, which is crucial for tasks like fine-tuning or using the model for inference.

-  **Tokenizer**: These tokenizers provide more flexibility and customization options. Use them when you need to adjust tokenization rules or handle specific tokenization tasks that might not be covered by a pre-trained tokenizer.

-  **Specialized Tokenizers**: Opt for these tokenizers when performance (speed) is critical. They are designed to handle tokenization tasks faster than standard tokenizers, making them suitable for applications that require quick processing times, such as real-time inference or handling large datasets efficiently.

Example Usage Scenario:

  **Scenario**: You want to fine-tune a BERT model on a specific dataset of scientific articles written in multiple languages.

  - **Tokenizer Choice:**
    
    1. Use a PreTrainedTokenizer like BertTokenizer if you are fine-tuning a BERT model available in the Hugging Face model hub. This ensures compatibility with the model's vocabulary and tokenization rules.
    
    2. If the articles contain specialized terminology or non-standard text, consider using a Tokenizer to customize tokenization rules to better handle such cases.
    
    3. If performance becomes an issue due to large volumes of text or real-time requirements, switch to a Specialized Tokenizer like BertTokenizerFast for faster processing.

In summary, the choice of tokenizer in Hugging Face depends on the specific requirements of your NLP task, including model compatibility, customization needs, and performance considerations.
